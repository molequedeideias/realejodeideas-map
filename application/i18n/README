Hello, welcome to the Ushahidi Translations repository. In order to contribute new translations, please fork the code here, make your modifications and submit a pull request to the master branch. Your pull request will be reviewed and merged with these translations that will be shared with the larger Ushahidi and Crowdmap community.

We automatically update a list of the "completeness" of languages on the Localizations wiki. It can be found here: https://github.com/ushahidi/Ushahidi-Localizations/wiki/Completeness

Are you totally new to Git and version control systems? Please head over to http://help.github.com/ and familiarize yourself before contributing. It is fairly technical but don't be discouraged! Just jump in and give it a try!
